\begin{questions}
    \question[20]
        Let $G$ be a group and $N\leq G$ a subgroup. Give any four conditions which are equivalent to $N$ being a normal subgroup of $G$.
    \question[30]
        Draw the subgroup lattice for the cyclic group $\langle x\rangle$, where $x$ has order $36$.
    \question[30]
        Let $N\leq H\leq G$ and assume that both $N$ and $H$ are normal subgroups of $G$. You may further assume that $H/N$ is a subgroup of $G/N$. Prove that $H/N$ is normal in $G/N$.
    \question[30]
        Let $H, K$ be normal subgroups of a group $G$, and assume $H\cap K = \{e\}$. Prove that $xy=yx$ for all $x\in H, \ y\in K$.
